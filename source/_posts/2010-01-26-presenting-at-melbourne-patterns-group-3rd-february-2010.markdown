Following on from my last post, I’m going to be presenting on continuous integration and Flot at the [Melbourne Patterns Group](http://melbournepatterns.org/) meeting next Wednesday. We’re meeting at Thoughtworks, Level 15, 303 Collins Street, Melbourne, Vic, 3000 from 6:30pm. Come along for the presentations and a free feed.
